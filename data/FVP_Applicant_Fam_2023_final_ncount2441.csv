They allow their teachers to be bullies and their way to fix it is to remove the child not fix the teacher. They have zero communication skills with parents. You will never know your child is having an issue until report card day when you see them failing. Lots of teachers are rude and recently their field lesson trip was the worst experince for a parent to have. I have even reached out to the principals supervisor and never got a response. It took me 6 months to get a hold of their principal. Teachers dont even talk to other teachers or their principals to address problems. I would never recommend y worse enemy to this campus. There needs to be some kind of PTA or something because you give them all the problems and they do nothing but protect their own teachers causing them.,I hope the new idea communicates with parents and has no teachers being bullies. I hope my son gets his services that he was suppose to recieve all year and i hope their education and parent concerns are taken seriously unlike at south flores,I just have high hopes for the new school we are going to. I do see they have some of the same problems though from talking to people so i just hope they listen to parent concerns because i will always advocate for my children and i really hope i dont have to take them back to a regular public school.

But yet IDEA seems to hire a lot of bullying staff. There is nobody at HQ who helps support the parents and the students whenever this is happening. IDEA condones this type of behavior from there staff. They at HQ refuse to investigate these types of situations. Because staff are bullies his in the heck can IDEA tackle the students who bully. When they don't do nothing to the staff. The staff even bullies other staff that they don't like and make there lives miserable until they leave. That's why IDEA has a high turn over rate. IDEA only want's there students to be black and brown. All there staff fits the bill. If your white your pushed out of the school. More white students are expelled, suspended, ISS, detention, written up kicked out and thrown out of the school. The staff allow the black and brown students get away with anything and everything they coddle and protect them have more patience for them. They'll lie and cover things up for them. They are literally allowed to bully and they won't get in trouble if it's being directed towards a white student and there parent or parents. The black and brown staff, students and parents are very racist towards white families and there kids. All the staff are very prejudice they don't care to hear the white student's side of things or there parent. They don't provide due process and a fair thorough investigation. Instead they blow you off and ignore you and nothing ever happens. IDEA is definitely not a school for all races it's only for black and brown kids and that's it. ","Reputation for academic excellence/Track record of success,The availability of extracurricular activities,Focus on whole child development,Commitment to college preparation,Family partnership approach,The availability of individualized learning opportunities,Highly qualified and trained staff,Other (Please specify)","Tutoring and Saturday school needs to be of high importance and it's in dire need to start immediately in September until STAAR testing is over. South Flores has had no Saturday School and hardly any tutoring if not at all. All the 8th grade team especially the ELA, Spanish and the new Math teacher who was a sub. They are not teaching properly or taking it seriously. All the students are worried that there not gonna pass the STAAR test this school year. And they don't want to repeat the 8th grade. None of the teachers in 8th grade actually teaching the students. Instead they give them work and expect them to already know it without explaining it or teaching it. This campus thinks that intervention is the only thing the students need. The true question is are the students really receiving that? I've found out that there not. And besides even if they are that's not enough for all students. Every kid doesn't get it right away. Because everyone learns differently not every student is gonna get it the first time around. And a lot of students are not gonna it if there style of learning is not being taught then there not gonna get it at all. All styles of learning should be taught. That's what makes Tutoring and Saturday school very vital and neceassary.

Instead of expelling them why don't you'll help them break the addiction and put them in a program similar for AAA. Have them do restoration y'all already have community service that students can do at the campus during lunch and all school events. So the students can accumulate community hours for graduation. They can do that to accomplish both. ",Other (Please specify),"TV advertising should mention that IDEA especially Monterrey Park, Carver and EastSide is only for black and brown kids. If your white go somewhere else. Come at your own risk and if you do. If anything goes down with a white student they are not gonna be believed. There is no due process the principal will only believe whatever the staff tells them. And the principal won't hear nothing your kid has to say or the parent. It's a us against them environment. Your kid will automatically be expelled and they'll receive no chances. Only the black and brown students are deserving of that kind of treatment. ",No,"All the factors that I've already mentioned in all my other, other sections. IDEA is in dire need to rehire all there staff from the very top to the bottom! But that won't happen! ",Restoration and Rehabilitation expulsion is truly last resort. And whenever this type situation is going down. All the staff from the bottom to the top make up there own rules as they go along! The students at this other school have pow wow round table talks. They do community hour service and it's also going towards there community hours they need to graduate. So they can go to a University. IDEA rushes in to expell it does matter if the student is an all A student has perfect attendance and has never been trouble never ever before. Instead none of that matters to IDEA they'll throw the book at you. The principal only listens to staff and it doesn't matter if the staff are lying about what there saying. ,What I've asked for which is a complete and total revamp of all staff. Will never happen IDEA doesn't think there crap don't stink. Just the families and the students. HQ doesn't care about the students and the parents. HQ treats you like a bother they don't investigate any concerns you have. Go to them and your just wasting your time. It's literally a free for all for staff they are allowed to be as mean and as rude and as nasty as ever! Call cops on them and they'll believe the staff not the students or the parent.
