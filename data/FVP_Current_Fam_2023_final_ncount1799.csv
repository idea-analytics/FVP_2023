It is imperative that leadership find a way to foster an environment that leads to teacher/staff retention when they are successfully teaching our children. We can not be dismissive and they that teachers are not needed because they don’t appease  the leadership and just have them walk out the door. Our students, my students needs theses teachers to finish out lessons and help them be better prepared for testing. It does not see, that the leadership feels that way at all and that all of the teachers are expendable. While, we may be but there is a reason that you allow students to finish out the year. Also, think that academy side needs better leadership and truly cares about these students. Some of these teachers are just not qualified/have the patience to be around children. If IDEA hired teachers that loved the job and the purpose they serve would be greatly appreciated. It seems as though they are only interested in the breaks and having an easy job and not all kids are the same, it requires a skill to get and teach all children. The school does not do field trips at any grade level and doing things in the gym from time to time is not the solution.

Students need to be challenged and engaged. If they master one course they should be able to move forward with another course not held back with the whole class until everyone semi-catches up. Teachers need to be engaging with students and individualize their studies. Students and parents should feel safe in every campus. Video monitoring needs to be everywhere to stop violence and drug use. Teachers should be held liable when not performing their duties. Campus need to communicate more with the parents not only tell students the information and assume it will reach the parents. Teachers should have required conferences with all students & parents to better their skills and academia. Incidents that occur on campus should be reported not hushed up and have no record of them. Campus should get together with local police departments to have a couple or police men be on school grounds at all times. Campus need a guidance counselor that is there for them for mental and curriculum issues that have an actual counseling degree. Campuses need better choices for lunches that are appealing to kids. Campus should have all classes recorded for when a student is absent they know what lectures are about and not be told they didn’t miss much. All class recordings and assignments should be posted on online portal for students and for parents to view so they can assist kids at home. Every instructor should have a calendar with material they will cover with extra resources so students & parents know exactly what the students are studying at all times. ,Every instructor to have various teaching methods. Challenge students and have them engaged. Video monitoring is a must so students can feel a bit safer and not be pressured to do drug and be violent. Campuses need to have local police departments to have policemen on campus grounds at all times. Students should be required to speak to a licensed Councelor to be viewed as a whole and have a safe space to speak about their concerns and academia. Students should have all classes recorded for when a student is absent they know what lectures are about and not be told they didn’t miss much. All class recordings and assignments should be posted on online portal for students and for parents to view so they can assist kids at home. Every instructor should have a calendar with material they will cover with extra resources so students & parents know exactly what the students are studying at all times. ,It’s a better school than other school districts but they are not great for extra curriculum activities or being their for students as a whole. Communication is horrible between campus and parents. Campus need a lot of work to be a good school for students.,"Security is horrible. My kid was left behind and held back by a stranger and after that he was acting out and no one knew why. He told the teacher what happened and they didn’t do anything about it. I messaged the teacher and she didn’t responded until days later and then did nothing about it. I spoke with team leader and then to assistant principal which then she implied something bad happened between the stranger and my son that’s why he’s been acting out and then she didn’t do anything about it. By that I mean there was not even a report made. She said she would have the principal speak with me and she never made a conference for us to meet. I requested a conference several times and didn’t get one. She spoke with the instructor who walked the class to lunch when my son was approached at that time but no repercussion were given to instructor. Assistant principal called me one day and told me they were letting a different department look into the issue. Then she called me again saying they couldn’t do anything about it and were now handing over the issue to a government department and gave me a case number. She mentioned they would call me. I asked for a contact and phone number and she said she didn’t have that information that they would call me. I requested super attendant information and the people above them information also and she said she did not know it but she would get back to me and she never did get me that information. Nobody ever called me about it again. In academics, students need to be challenged and engaged in ever class. Students should have an option to move on to next topic while other students are working on the material they are having difficulties with. Communication between campus and parents is not great. Campus should have a portal where all information given to kids is viewable for parents. Idea seems like a good school for academia compared to other campus only because they have students concentrate on academia and not having a well rounded being of students. Idea lacks a lot but for academia part it’s better. Numbers are important to Idea and sometimes that makes teachers give students grades they didn’t accomplish.  "

They will be better equipped to take on the real world if they are helped to process certain emotions. Education in its own does not constitute success. We try our best as parents but I can assure that most parents in our community do not support psychological needs at home due to our broken Hispanic culture mindset. They do not speak about issues at home. Their feelings and emotions are never validated at home and are forced to keep quiet. Boys are taught that they cannot show emotion and bottle it up while girls are taught to see abuse as normal and are taught to not speak up.  ,It’s is a different culture. A different way of thinking about education. The current system has not been working nationwide and we are falling behind as a country. This school is better prepared to push our children forward and begin to make changes in for our country’s future. A better future starts with our kids. ,It has been a wonderful change for all of us. I have never felt more comfortable in their education than I do now and I look forward to what my children will accomplish.

In all of our son’s years of school, he has been his favorite teacher and mentor. He engages with our son and communicates with him in a way that motivate him. He looks forward to his class every single day.    I would also like to mention Mrs. Mendoza.  Our son thoroughly enjoys her class, even when something is being taught that he isn’t too fond of, like poetry.   As far as our son being “taught” social emotional learning, I disagree that this is a role the school should take. We teach that to our child at home and do not agree with some of the theories or concepts taught at school.   I think the front end receptionist needs another assistant. I have tried in the past to call to ask a question or let IDEA know our son will not be in school and the phone goes to voicemail.  I don’t normally leave a message because I did not receive a return call when I have.  I have observed the receptionist filling out the re-enrollment for a parent!  That should not be her responsibility. Hiring of another receptionist isn’t a luxury but a necessity. IDEA shouldn’t try to wring out every minute of work from all its employees.   Dismissal personnel should come outside to take student numbers well before 3:45 dismissal. When I submitted the survey to IDEA Robindale I recommended the personnel coming outside earlier but one person in particular that used to say hello to me no longer does. Perhaps she was told what was said on the survey. But they continue to come outside at 3:42 -3:43, which I think is unacceptable, to obtain the dismissal numbers from the vehicles. By the time our son is dismissed, it is after 3:45.  One of the reasons I bring this up is because when we are in line to drop off our son, there have been two occasions this last quarter when a child did not want to get off the vehicle and when our son was walking into the school, he was marked tardy. I don’t agree with students being marked tardy when that happens. The students are there on time but are marked tardy because they are not unloaded on time.    The person that obtains the dismissal numbers have to get numbers from about three transport vans that carry 10-15 students.  Those children should be brought out first so there isn’t a cluster of kids trying to get out of the gate at the same time as the parent pick up and running toward the vans. Maybe even allow the school bus transportation to leave a couple of minutes before 3:45 so they aren’t having to deal with the traffic of parents leaving at dismissal.  It would be much safer.   As far as us feeling that our son is safe at school, we do to a certain point. However, we believe that armed security is best for the school because IDEA does not have its own police force.   As far as our son not being involved in any clubs, he was the class president for 6th grade and there was never any announcement as to him being elected by his peers.  It wasn’t until I asked about the results. He was involved in student council and looked forward to the meetings and participating; however, I feel that the functions of student council as a definition, was not fully implemented. He would only help make posters for pep rally and carnival posters. And he also helped at the carnival. But as far as implementing or communicating any ideas and being the class representative, the role was not met. He wanted to talk about implementing NHS and Jr. NHS in order to help assist with scholarships. He also had students complain to him about some of the food served but was never granted a platform to discuss it. This year there isn’t a student council because there isn’t a “sponsor”, which is unfortunate.   There is also no chess club and I assume it’s because there isn’t a sponsor for that either.   Not only are the clubs limited but so are the elective classes at IDEA when our son is  going to be entering high school.   Although we are very happy with the teachers that our son has and the way they treat him, we know he is still wanting more than what IDEA has to offer. When i mentioned this to his counselor, she seemed a little dismissive and said that we need to do what is best for our son.   As it looks right now, we are considering moving our son to BISD when he enters high school for those reasons. They have courses he can take such as culinary arts and “work” at a pharmacy during his senior year to be a certified pharmacy  technician, because he wants to study pharmacy. They also offer chess clubs, student council, NHS swimming, golf and far too many others to list.   I hope this candid survey helps in the future. ","Offer more clubs and extra curricular activities such as chess, student council, NHS, Jr. NHS, home economics, work study programs, swimming, golf. ",I would tell them my honest opinion. IDEA Robindale is still not at the level of BISD as far as high school but the elementary and middle school is great. ,N/A

Idea edinburg college prep never answers their phone. When they do they never have an answer never know what’s going on never can provide any kind of information. There is little to no communication with parents. Especially for events or tutoring. I never know tutoring schedule or if it’s even canceled until my child is out of class at 3:45 and calls saying they cancelled tutoring. What is the point of having the remind app if school doesn’t communicate with PARENTS,Ideas teachers needs more one on one help from counselors or psychologist to really help kids with learning disabilities. For example adhd build a curriculum not set up for them to fail. Adhd kids have such a hard time focusing and asking for help. They don’t need to be punished or shamed for it.,I would say it’s better than public schools in the rgv,

Diligently working with scholars presence in schoo, making sure they are involved and ready to learn. My scholar lost interest in coming to school because of the administration. We need the right administration in place that will be present in school, equal and fair not make decision based on ones feelings, supportive not hostile or destuctive to ones sanity or work place environment. Better communication between teachers and scholars, change some rules because school os supposed to be a learning environment not a prison and that what it feels like to scholars i understand the uniforms but shoes, jackets, shouldnt be so strict it because at the end of the day not all colleges have uniforms or strict clothing appearances. The descipline of knowing how to dress when need be is important, not all scholars will enter a workplace environment that requires a uniform lets be real. More social interactions with different grade levels because our scholars will encounter all walks of life  after they graduate and they can learn from the different age groups. Making school fun and inviting i believe would make a happy thriving school. When it comes to dealing with how to discipline a scholar (s) due to behavior or an incident needs to be fair all around and for all again not based on just what the ""ADULTS"" say, scholars need to be heard too. Majority of the food sucks just being honest and thats coming from my scholars and other scholars, if a school is supposed to be and A rating in food then why does the kids say it scuks and dont eat a revision of how the food is made and with what seasonings need to be done ASAP, kids waste food because it tastes weird. Last but not least counselors need to know how to council seriously and some teachers need to learn how to teach and talk to scholars. And the athletic department needs help!!! Either with fundraising/fundraisers and booster clubs or parent club something because an athletic department without money is a joke there are families wanting to help. Annd IDEAs need prom something for the kids to enjoy a night with each other making memories getting all dolled up and looking good before they enter the real world.",Listening to them with an open mind and truly hearing what they have to say. Negotiating and having common ground on topics and everyday school life so they can go to school willing and happy. And even on a scholars bad day being at school should help them turn it around.
